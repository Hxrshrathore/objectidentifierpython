# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv3 and OpenCV 👀🔍

This repository contains a Python script for real-time object detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) model with OpenCV. The YOLOv3 model is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection that can detect multiple objects in an image or video in real-time. 🚀

## Key Features 🌟

- Real-time object detection: The script processes video frames from the webcam feed in real-time, detecting and labeling objects with bounding boxes. 🎥🚀
- YOLOv3 Model: The YOLOv3 model architecture is used for accurate and efficient object detection with high-speed performance. 🏛️
- COCO Dataset: The model is trained on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, allowing it to detect a wide range of common objects. 🗃️
- Easy Setup: The repository provides the necessary YOLOv3 model configuration file (`yolov3.cfg`), pretrained weights file (`yolov3.weights`), and class names file (`coco.names`) for easy setup. 🛠️
- User-Friendly Interface: The script displays the webcam feed with real-time object detection results in a window. Press the "Esc" key to stop the script gracefully. 📷

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 🖥️
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and the required libraries (OpenCV and NumPy) installed. 🐍
3. Place the `yolov3.cfg`, `yolov3.weights`, and `coco.names` files in the same directory as the Python script. 📁
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. 📂
5. Run the Python script using the command: `python main.py`. 🚀
